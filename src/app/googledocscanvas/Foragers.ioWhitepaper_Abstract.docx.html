		Foragers.io

	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Foragers.io is a marketplace of hunter-gatherers. These peers are involved
		in an ecosystem of trade and bartering that is not bound by location or
		time spent. The marketplace welcomes P-2-P projects, while it can also be
		utilized by organizations to boost innovation.

	<br/>

		Hunter-Gatherers?
	</h1>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The Hunter-gatherer started their evolution roughly 1.8 million years ago.
		The Hunter-Gatherers went from place to place; during these travels they
		traded with other tribes to sustain themselves. They did not waste any
		materials as waste meant tremendous amounts of extra effort.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Some 80.000 to 70.000 years ago, the transition started going towards
		specialization of the skills and the creation of tools. The Agricultural
		revolution has happened. Initially, this was an awesome, selected, and
		stable food source, no more moving around the globe and being able to call
		a place home. They became highly dependent on the land they were living on.
		Protection was needed to survive; technology evolved for good and bad.
		Centralization of work meant a constraint of location and work hours.
		Centralised power and landownership brought inequality.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		After all these years we are now in the digital revolution where the need
		for safety and food can be traded through currency and services.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The Foragers.io DAO aims to usher in a new revolution, the next step in
		evolution, by lifting the archaic restraints of location, time, and
		centralised power that the neolithic, industrial lifestyle gave us.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The hunter-gatherers have projects to work.
	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">
		They have a need to monetize their skills, knowledge, or (local) network,
		free from the constraints of time and location.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
	The system follows in the footsteps of known systems such as<a href="http://gitcoin.co"> gitcoin.co</a>,<a href="https://www.hackerone.com/"> hackerone</a>, and    <a href="http://airtasker.com"> airtasker.com</a>. These boil down to
		variations of reverse auctions and reverse marketplaces.
	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">
		A reverse marketplace is a space where demand is central and creates the
		initial steps for action.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		A concrete example of a reverse auction. A government decides to build a
		bridge, calculates a budget of 20million, and then opens up this budget to
		several public or preselected third parties who can bring in a bid out of
		which the best is rewarded the public contract.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		We aim to have a system that focuses as well on the digital aspect of
		tasks/bounties as well on the physical aspect. We’ve seen countless web3.0
		projects pop up intending to have bounties for creating pieces of their
		software system. Just as we have seen a lack of these bounties calling for
		local/ community efforts. Through the volatility of NFT’s, we’ve seen how
		powerful the community is in being able to create support for projects.
		Community-backed projects tend to have higher returns than purely
		money-marketed projects. Obviously, to most of us, that makes sense;
		however, during the practicalities of creating and finishing a project,
		sometimes certain resources are lacking, and money can fill in that gap.
	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">
		XXXXX This way, we want to allow hunter-gatherers to place bounties on our
		platform that require boots on the ground, from organizing meetups to being
		physically on location. This way, if you’re a hunter-gatherer that has been
		working on a project and is planning to launch your product, you can set up
		local events in your target area to be able to reach your targeted group in
		person rather than merely through digital media.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The need for systems like these has been since human memory. It allows the
		gatherer to be open for solutions they couldn’t imagine themselves. While
		if executed correctly it’s a fair and transparent game for hunters and
		their tribes. The need for a medium of trust to trade with peers you don’t
		trust yet has been existent throughout all of our histories. With the
		evolution of humanity, technology has new trust and process issues between
		both parties.

		Foragers aims to contribute to the evolving movement of the existing
		reverse market system through a combination of decentralized solutions such
		as DAO’s and tokenomics. Our main mission remains to remove constraints to
		free your time. We believe a decentralized reverse marketplace will allow
		us to lift your constraints to help with reaching peers their personal
		goals. The benefits of such a system are balanced with knowledge and
		effort. You shouldn’t be required to work for the same amount of benefits
		if you would be able to do your work in half of the average time. You
		should be allowed to work less and earn more rather than spend your time
		wasted due to not being rewarded correctly.

	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The system is being designed for the public domain as much as linking b2b
		parties to the system for bounties or tasks. This allows organizations to
		aim to address innovation challenges that would normally not be touched
		upon by them due to their daily constraints of expected workload. For
		example, organizational Innovation teams can use this system to reach an
		unknown third party that could bring new perspectives to their specific
		innovation needs.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<h1 dir="ltr">
		DAO
	</h1>
	<p dir="ltr">
		We intend to use a DAO as a governing structure. This DAO will help settle
		disputes over bounties, designate the good deed bounties, and propose
		community solutions backed by their reputation. Official communications
		happen on transparent platforms that allow traceability.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The dao will set up systems to handle disputes and innovate the network
		towards its goal of offering everyone equal chances to break out of 9-5
		contracts. It will allow trade based on their knowledge and skills. The DAO
		will earn its income by % of transactions and through the handling of
		disputes. This % will be defined by the organizational costs of auditing,
		creating, and maintaining the marketplace. This will be decided through a
		vote and proposal from within the DAO.

	<h1 dir="ltr">
		Reputation
	</h1>
	<p dir="ltr">
		is a side benefit gained from completing bounties, community tasks, good
		deeds, pro-active fixes, and maintaining the project. Reputation is linked
		to 1 wallet and cannot be transferred nor traded. The purpose of this
		reputation system is to decrease the spam on bounties with half attempts.
		Each bounty will require you to stake a # of reputation to be able to reply
		with a plan/proposition/work. Successful completion of a project will
		reward you reputation coins based on the size and difficulty of a bounty.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Certain bounties might have a minimum or maximum reputation to apply for
		it. This is to ensure the good nature of applicants to a bounty and, at the
		same time, allow bigger projects to be taken up by peers or tribes who have
		a history of successful contributions to the community.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		There will be 3 different verticals of reputation badges under which one
		will be able to show its competency based on its specific skill set. The 3
		verticals will be characterised as Hustler, Designer, and Developer.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Hustler: People and financial skillsets, hunting for bounties to be
		released on the platform, organising projects, and managing clients.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Developer: Executioner of the plans of creation. From software to
		woodworking and anywhere in between.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Designers: Aesthetical creators, designers of plans and strategy,
		architectural design, and anything that falls in between those cracks.
	</p>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Using the zero-knowledge proof concept as a base for our reputation systems
		professionals will show their skills and past (disputed) deals. It will
		allow for space of proof of expertise without having constant maintenance
		on the part of our tribes.

		The charity system is a way to give back to the community through all of

		Escrow Smart contract system
	</h1>
	<p dir="ltr">
		The Escrow Smart contract system is a technical evolution of current
		processes. It allows us to create bounties to showcase an open call for
		certain needs. It allows us to keep full transparency and dissolves the
		involvement of an active 3rd party providing escrow services. After all,
		there have been many scams on digital and anonymous trading in the past.
		The use of smart contract escrow systems will reduce costs, increase
		efficiency and allow for larger projects to be created with a safety lever
		on both sides to ensure the right full acting of both parties in a deal or
		bounty is guaranteed.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Audited templates will be funded by the HGDao On which the bounties can be
		initiated. Initially, we will start with 1 to 2 templates. And then grow
		these towards where the community finds the need to customise. HGDAOs goal
		will be to make these systems as intuitive and secure as possible. This
		would allow everyone to adopt these smart contracts as a way to ensure
		safety as the growth in the digital economy grows.
	</p>
	<br/>
	<p dir="ltr">
		Escrow currently gets used for a variety of user cases such as car sales,
		construction milestones, and project milestones. HGDao’s first focus will
		be on a milestone system which will allow the use for various projects
		rather than a single niche system.
	</p>
